In this project, GitHub Copilot generated several of the core functions in my data_cleaning.py script. I prompted Copilot by writing descriptive comments above each function, such as “# Load the raw CSV file into a DataFrame” or “# Remove invalid rows such as negative prices.” From these comments, Copilot suggested function structures for load_data, clean_column_names, handle_missing_values, and remove_invalid_rows. These suggestions provided a helpful starting point and saved time by generating boilerplate code automatically.
I modified Copilot’s suggestions to better fit the assignment requirements. For example, I renamed variables to be more consistent, changed the logic for handling missing values, and added explicit conversions to numeric types to avoid errors when comparing strings to integers. I also simplified a few overly complex Copilot suggestions so that the code was easier to read and matched my exact cleaning steps. These changes were necessary to make the script run correctly and to ensure the cleaning pipeline produced a usable processed file.
Through this assignment, I learned how important it is to verify and adjust Copilot’s output rather than accept it blindly. I also gained hands-on experience with data cleaning in Python—especially how to handle messy column names, missing values, and invalid data. Copilot is very helpful for generating structure and speeding up routine code writing, but it sometimes produces code that does not fully match the context or data type issues, so human review is essential. This project showed me how Copilot can be a useful assistant when combined with my own understanding of pandas and data cleaning logic.
